# Copter - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1992

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Inspired by the [Fox video game](http://jeuxvideos8090.free.fr/index.php?Id_Soft=132) released in 1985 for [Thomson TO7 and MO5 microcomputers](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_TO7/70), Copter places us in the role of a helicopter pilot out to harvest mushrooms in caves full of obstacles and traps.

Here you'll find the source codes for the game and its level editors, developed in [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) for MS-Dos in 1992.

The compiled versions of the game (dated April 17, 1995) and its ancillary programs are available in the “release” folder, along with a first series of 16 game levels. The three other published series of 16 rooms are also available in the numbered “release-DLC” folders. You should be able to run them on an MS-Dos emulator or an 8-bit version of Windows (3.x, 95 and maybe 98).

The editors used to create the ancillary files (mouse cursor, sprites, color palette, texts in several languages, etc.) are or will one day be available as source code and compiled programs on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal?tab=repositories&q=Maker+TurboPascal&type=&language=&sort=).

It's possible that these programs are compilable with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) but I haven't tried. Units not supplied can be found in the [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal) repository. If any are missing, please let me know so that I can add them.

This video game was recreated in 2021 during [streaming sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin). Renamed [Champter](https://champter.gamolf.fr/), it works in the same way, but has been completely redesigned in Delphi for use on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. [Its source codes](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Champter) are open.
